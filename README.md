### Hi, I'm Steph ðŸ‘‹

I'm a marine biologist turned data scientist, ready to dive deeper into the world of data! You can check out my most recent project 'Predicting Flight Delays' which used US domestic flight data from 2020-2021 to predict future flight delays using supervised machine learning.

I'd love to connect and talk data, or biology, or maybe even swap travel stories!
